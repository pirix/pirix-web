# Pirix

Pirix is an attempt to create a compact, POSIX-compatible and
microkernel-based operating system.

## Getting started

Pirix has to be build from source because there are currently no
ready-to-use images available. Instructions on how to build Pirix can
be found in the [Documentation](/doc/building/).

## Supported Platforms

* i386
* ARM
   * QEMU Integrator/CP
   * Raspberry Pi
